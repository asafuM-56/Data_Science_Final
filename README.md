Zeolites are important in catalysis and adsorption processes, but are difficult to find optimal formation conditions.

This model predicts the succes or failure of the formation of zeolite using the following features
1. Seed properties:
- Seed amount (normalized to SiO2 weight = 1)
- Seed framework density (FD) in T/Å3

2. Gel composition:
- NaOH/SiO2 molar ratio
- B2O3/SiO2 molar ratio
- H2O/SiO2 molar ratio
- OTMAC/SiO2 molar ratio (SDA)

4. Crystallization conditions:
- Crystallization temperature (°C)
- Crystallization time (days)
